# AI Chat Bot
This is an AI Chat Bot that stores your answers in a local txt file database as a dictionary of question(key) and answer(value). You can ask questions and provide correct answers if AI's answer is fully or partially incorrect!

# Face Recognition Bot
You can use this bot to check if any human face is found in a set of images. If it is so you can either give a name to every person found in every image or to skip that process.

# Password Generator
PassGen is a basic password generator script based on user preferences. You can choose what kind of characters to be included into your password string!

# Screenshot Bot
Just start the script and type 'ss'. The bot will countdown from 5 and take the screenshot. Your file will be saved with 'JPEG' extension in the same directory with the working script!

# YouTube Downloader
YouTube Downloader is one of my favorite tools! You can get rid of the idea of downloading your favourite songs using those annoying websites. They try to charge you and get your money or show you many ads for nothing. Feel free to use it. Save the whole folder in your pc. You can choose to modify the download folder path once you run the script. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD PLAYLISTS TOO!
