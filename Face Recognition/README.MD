# Detects wheter an image contains a human face or not
Just be sure to provide the set of images in the folder 'images' that should be inside the same directory with the script on running.

If any face is found in a photo you will have the option to give a name for that person or to skip.

# Install all dependencies
If you want to run the bot be sure that you've already installed the neccesary modules:
